# Francis Allocation Model using C#
With this novel method, challenge to back-allocate commingled fluids with different PVT behaviors can be solved systematically using correlations of oil shrinkage and gas-oil ratio in a mathematical allocation algorithm. This methodology was applied on a field case in offshore Vietnam where produced oil and gas commingled from clastic reservoirs and granite fractured basement reservoir. It is verified against PVT data from lab and other measurements.
